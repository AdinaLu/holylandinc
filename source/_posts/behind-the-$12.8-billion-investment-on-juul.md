Its characteristics of portable, simple, and user-friendly make it convenient for smokers to quit smoking. JUUL’s pods including Virginia Tobacco, Fruit, Mint, Mango and four other flavors have gained its popularity among youth and bring up a fashion for pod system.

Except for JUUL, some popular pre-filled pod system brands available on the market are Vuse, Hexa, Blu, and SMOK. Their competition on flavors, design and user experience are promoting scientific and technological progress and a new trend of cooperation, such as the recent Golden Leaf Awards Winner —— FEELM tech, another [new vaping technology](http://www.feelmtech.com/) that has great development potential.
